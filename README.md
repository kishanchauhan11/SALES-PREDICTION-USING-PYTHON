# Sales Forecasting Model  
**Created by KISHAN CHAUHAN**  

---

## Project Overview  
This project develops a machine learning model in Python to predict future sales trends using historical data. The goal is to optimize advertising spend efficiency and enhance business intelligence by providing actionable insights.  

---

## Key Features  
- Sales forecasting powered by machine learning.  
- Integration of advertising spend, audience demographics, and platform data.  
- Comprehensive analysis for business decision-making.

## Workflow  

### 1. Data Collection  
- Collected historical sales records with corresponding:  
  - Advertising expenditure  
  - Audience demographics  
  - Ad platforms used  
- Cleaned raw data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualized trends and correlations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  
- Identified key variables influencing sales (e.g., ad spend, platform performance).  
- Discovered seasonal patterns and declining/upward correlations.  

### 3. Feature Engineering  
- Created new features such as:  
  - Interaction terms between ad spend and audience groups.  
  - Time-based features (e.g., month, quarter).  
  - Platform-specific performance metrics.  

### 4. Model Selection  
- Tested multiple algorithms:  
  - **Linear Regression**  
  - **Random Forest**  
  - **XGBoost** (final model due to superior performance).  

### 5. Model Training & Tuning  
- Trained the model using Scikit-learn.  
- Optimized hyperparameters via **k-fold cross-validation**.  

### 6. Prediction & Evaluation  
- Forecasted future sales trends.  
- Evaluated accuracy using:  
  - **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)  
  - **RÂ² Score** (Coefficient of Determination)  
  - **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)

## Business Impact  
- Provided data-driven recommendations to:  
  - Allocate advertising budgets efficiently.  
  - Improve sales conversion rates.  
  - Enhance long-term business strategy.

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**  
- **Scikit-learn** (modeling)  
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** (data manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** (visualization)
